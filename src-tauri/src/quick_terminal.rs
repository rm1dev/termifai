//! Quick Terminal: a Quake-style slide-in terminal panel on a dedicated,
//! non-draggable, non-resizable window anchored to a screen edge.
//!
//! The native window is never animated or resized by the OS; the slide
//! animation runs inside the webview (CSS transforms) and resizing happens
//! only through an in-panel drag handle that calls `resize_quick_terminal`.
//! See docs/quick-terminal-plan.md for the full design, including why this is
//! best-effort on Linux/Wayland (xdg-shell offers no toplevel positioning).
